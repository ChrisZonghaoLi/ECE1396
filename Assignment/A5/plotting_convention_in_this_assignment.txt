how to plot for this questions (+ and - of v-r2r and v-ther)?

for trans: v(vout_r2r+)-v(vout_r2r-)+v(vout_ther+)-v(vout_ther+)
for pass: db20(v(vout_r2r+)-v(vout_r2r-)+v(vout_ther+)-v(vout_ther+))

It is because I define the convention a bit wrong (+ and - for ther)

also, when plot, do not close the calculator, keep it on
